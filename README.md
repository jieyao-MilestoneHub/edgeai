# Edge AI Learning Path

A shared journey toward becoming **Runtime AI Platform Leaders and AI System Architects**.
As AI-assisted coding becomes mainstream, we’re diving deeper — into **Edge AI**,
where models truly run, not just exist.
No trends. No noise. Just systems that work.

## Lab Introduction

Each lab is structured into four main folders:

* **`assets/`** – Stores experiment results, findings, and discussions.
* **`docs/`** – Provides conceptual and implementation guides to help readers understand each step.
* **`lab_tasks/`** – The experimental workspace where models are executed and evaluated.
* **`scripts/`** – Contains utility files such as environment checks or setup tools essential for running the lab.
