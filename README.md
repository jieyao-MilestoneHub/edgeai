# Edge AI Learning Path

A collection of **labs, experiments, and overheated machines**.
No titles, no trends — just hands-on exploration in **Edge AI**,
where models *run hot*, *fail fast*, and *teach us how to build better systems*.

No hype. No shortcuts. Only labs that work.

## Lab Introduction

Each lab is structured into four main folders:

* **`assets/`** – Stores experiment results, findings, and discussions.
* **`docs/`** – Provides conceptual and implementation guides to help readers understand each step.
* **`lab_tasks/`** – The experimental workspace where models are executed and evaluated.
* **`scripts/`** – Contains utility files such as environment checks or setup tools essential for running the lab.
